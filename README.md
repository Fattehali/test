## 8. Phased Migration Strategy

### 8.1. High-level Architecture Diagram
Below is planning and assessment that we can do for GlobalTech Solutions:

#### **Phase 1. Assessment**
- **Inventory Current Systems**:  
  We can begin by cataloging all servers, applications, and databases for the GlobalTech Solutions. Tools like AWS Application Discovery Service can provide a detailed understanding of system dependencies, configurations, and resource utilization, forming a comprehensive baseline for migration. We will use AWS Migration Hub to analyze the current on-premises environment.
  
- **Identify Critical Applications**:  
  Prioritize mission-critical systems such as e-commerce platforms and Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) applications that require high availability and have strict compliance or security requirements. Understanding these workloads ensures the migration plan aligns with business priorities and risk tolerance. For GlobalTech Solutions, we can consider financial management and public-facing e-commerce applications as critical.

- **Assess Cloud Readiness**:  
  Evaluate the technical feasibility of migrating legacy systems, including mainframes and monolithic ERP systems. This assessment identifies workloads suitable for lift-and-shift migrations and those that may need refactoring, ensuring an optimized migration strategy. So, for GlobalTech Solutions we can use lift-and-shift for virtual machines (VMs). For our monolithic ERP system and legacy application, we will need to refactor or re-platform to compatible with cloud-native.

- **Define Success Metrics**:  
  Set clear objectives for the migration, such as reduced operational costs, improved performance, scalability, and compliance adherence. These metrics will serve as benchmarks to measure the success of the migration process.

  Establish clear roles within the migration team and involve key stakeholders throughout the process. This will ensure accountability, smooth communication, and effective execution of the migration plan.

---

#### **Phase 3. Execution**
The actual migration will happen here, it involves moving workloads to AWS, ensuring data integrity, and minimizing downtime.

- **Rehosting (Lift-and-Shift)**:  
  Migrate 150 virtual machines to AWS using AWS Application Migration Service. Main benefit of that is quick migration without code changes and ideal for systems with tight migration windows.

- **Replatforming**:  
  GlobalTech Solutions can leverage AWS Mainframe Modernization tools to replatform its legacy mainframe system (payroll and reporting), ensuring improved scalability and cost-efficiency. By refactoring the mainframe applications into modern cloud-native services, they can transition to a microservices-based architecture using Amazon ECS or EKS. This approach ensures seamless integration with AWS databases like Amazon Aurora and Redshift for reporting and analytics. The modernization will resolve end-of-life challenges of the legacy system. We can use tools like AWS Blu Age which will help automated transformation of legacy application if written in COBOL into modern application.

- **Refactoring**:  
  For our monolithic application for GlobalTech Solutions, we can break down monolithic ERP system for financial and inventory management applications into microservices using Amazon ECS or Amazon EKS for container orchestration. We will use AWS Lambda for serverless compute service for events like adding/removing product to cart for their e-commerce site.

- **Database Migration**:  
  GlobalTech Solutions can migrate its on-premises SQL database cluster to Amazon RDS, enabling highly available and scalable database operations with multi-AZ replication for improved fault tolerance. This ensures minimal downtime and automatic failover capabilities, critical for handling sensitive customer and operational data. The migration can be done using AWS Database Migration Service (DMS), which supports continuous replication during the migration process to reduce disruption.

- **Data Transfer**:  
  For GlobalTech Solutions, AWS Snowball, AWS DataSync, AWS Direct Connect can be utilized to efficiently migrate small to large volumes of data from its on-premises infrastructure to the AWS cloud. AWS Snowball tools are ideal for handling the company's substantial datasets, especially in locations with limited network bandwidth. We will use AWS Direct Connect to establish dedicated private network connection between GlobalTech Solutions on-premises data center to AWS, which will enable faster and more secure data transfer. We can use AWS DataSync for data transfers between on-premises storage and AWS services like Amazon S3 and Amazon Elastic File System (EFS).

## 9. Legacy System Modernization
Modernizing legacy systems ensures long-term viability and better utilization of AWS features and is necessary to modernize applications that are at the end of their lifecycle or are no longer supported with AWS.

### 9.1. ERP Modernization
For GlobalTech Solutions, modernizing the monolithic ERP system is critical to address its scalability and flexibility challenges, particularly for financial and inventory management functions. The monolithic architecture will be transformed into a microservices-based design, leveraging container orchestration platforms like Amazon ECS or Amazon EKS. This shift will enable the ERP system to scale efficiently, enhance fault tolerance, and reduce maintenance complexity.

Key functions such as financial data processing and inventory tracking can be refactored to utilize AWS Lambda for serverless execution, which will enable event-driven operations with minimal latency. Amazon RDS can also connect to the ERP system.

### 9.2. Mainframe Modernization
For GlobalTech Solutions, the legacy mainframe system used for payroll and reporting will be replatformed to AWS using AWS Mainframe Modernization. The legacy-based code that does not support on AWS will be converted into modern programming languages supported by AWS, such as Java or C#, to align with contemporary development practices.

This approach ensures that the payroll and reporting systems remain operational while gaining the benefits of cloud scalability, lower maintenance costs, and enhanced disaster recovery capabilities. By modernizing the mainframe, GlobalTech will address the end-of-life challenges of the legacy system while improving performance and integrating seamlessly with other AWS services.
